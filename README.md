# MPOSE2021 Dataset

This repository contains the MPOSE2021 Dataset for short-time pose-based Human Action Recognition (HAR). 

MPOSE2021 is developed as an evolution of the MPOSE Dataset [1-3]. It is made by human pose data detected by OpenPose [4] on popular datasets for HAR, i.e. Weizmann [5], i3DPost [6], IXMAS [7], and KTH [8] alongside original video dataset, i.e. ISLD and ISLD-Additional-Sequences [1]. Since these datasets had heterogenous action labels, each dataset labels were remapped to a common and homogeneous list of actions.

This repository contains the scripts to generate MPOSE2021 dataset starting from the original RGB sequences belonging to the above-mentioned dataset. For licence-related reasons, the user must download RGB data from the original sources, as explanined in the manual.
